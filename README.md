# Apriori-algo
This repo contains the jupyter notebook and dataset of my apriori algorithm testing for Association Rule based learning algorithms.
## Methodology
I'm going to first try just do it using a ML library (mlxtend in this case), then I'll try to program the whole algo and play around with it's architecture to see how things bend.
